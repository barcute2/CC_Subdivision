After unzipping the files, open up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing mp4.cpp
For a fresh executable, type "make clean" and then "make".
To launch the application, type "./mp4"
By default, the letter I will show up. To toggle the wireframe, press "W". To toggle the filled I again, press "F".
To call the subdivision function, press "S". Each time you press "S", a new division will be created (tends to be hard
on the GPU after 4). Feel free to switch between the wireframe and the filled letter-I anytime.
